## Proposal
### Submission topic
Title: Itâ€™s Not Us, Its Them 

### Description 
> Coffee shops are busy places, people order coffee with confusing names, wander about and then complain that their coffee is cold by the time the barrista has found them. To solve this and reduce the workload on the cafe staff, we propose to create a robot that takes the coffee, finds the correct customer and puts the coffee in their hand.
