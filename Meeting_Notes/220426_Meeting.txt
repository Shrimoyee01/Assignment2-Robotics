Teams notes
Gavin:
Over the past week I have enjoyed talking to many groups about your ideas and 
helping you to narrow down the scope and refine your focus. This usually meant 
asking teams to remember the key demonstrators for this assignment, e.g., combining 
what we did in Lab Assignment 1 (inverse kinematics, trajectory planning, robot and 
environment modeling and safety) with the material from the lab exercises in the 
second half of the session such as RMRC, collision detection/avoidance, a user 
interface that allows for joint-angle-based and end-effector Cartesian control, 
an e-stop with 2 actions to continue, and visual servoing at least with a simulated camera (see Week 10 Lab 8).
